## Overview 🌟
In this project, I've unleashed the power of collaborative filtering to recommend movies based on user similarity. Using Jupyter Notebook and the magic of Python libraries, I've created a system that thinks like a movie buff. Want to watch something that resonates with your taste? This system's got you covered! 

## Tasks and Implementation 🛠️

### Interaction Matrix 🧩
Creating the core of collaborative filtering, the interaction matrix is a matrix of dreams (or ratings!). It represents every user's relationship with movies.
- **Task**: Are we dense enough? Calculating the sparsity of the interaction matrix.

### User-User Collaborative Filtering 👥
Finding your movie-taste twins by calculating similarity among users.
- **Task**: Using cosine similarity to find user buddies.

### Movie Recommendations 🍿
Your personal movie guide tailored to your taste buds.
- **Task**: Creating a function to:
  - Receive a user's ID.
  - Find 10 similar users.
  - Calculate the top movie picks.
  - Serve you the top 10 rated movies.

### Function Execution 🏃‍♂️
See the magic happen! Run the function and get recommendations.
- **Task**: Call the function, sit back, and let the recommendations roll in!

### Application 📱
Aiming to serve every movie lover with personalized recommendations.
- **A Python application**: Enter a User ID and get movie recommendations on the fly!

## Dataset 📊
A dataset filled with ratings and preferences, included in the repository, waiting to guide you to your next favorite movie!
